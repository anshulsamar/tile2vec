# ## Predicting consumption expeditures
# 
# The parameters needed to produce the plots are as follows:
# 
# - country: Name of country being evaluated as a lower-case string
# - country_path: Path of directory containing LSMS data corresponding to the specified country
# - dimension: Number of dimensions to reduce image features to using PCA. Defaults to None, which represents no dimensionality reduction.
# - k: Number of cross validation folds
# - k_inner: Number of inner cross validation folds for selection of regularization parameter
# - points: Number of regularization parameters to try
# - alpha_low: Log of smallest regularization parameter to try
# - alpha_high: Log of largest regularization parameter to try
# - margin: Adjusts margins of output plot
# 
# The data directory should contain the following 5 files for each country:
# 
# - conv_features.npy: (n, 4096) array containing image features corresponding to n clusters
# - consumptions.npy: (n,) vector containing average cluster consumption expenditures
# - nightlights.npy: (n,) vector containing the average nightlights value for each cluster
# - households.npy: (n,) vector containing the number of households for each cluster
# - image_counts.npy: (n,) vector containing the number of images available for each cluster
# 
# Exact results may differ slightly with each run due to randomly splitting data into training and test sets.
